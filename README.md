# ESP32 Captive Portal with SQLite Database

This project demonstrates the setup of a captive portal using an ESP32 microcontroller, serving web pages from the SD card and storing data in an SQLite database. It allows users to interact with the captive portal to manage tasks, register, login, and logout.

## Features

- **Captive Portal**: Users can connect to the ESP32 access point and interact with the web interface.
- **SQLite Database**: Tasks and user authentication details are stored in an SQLite database.
- **Task Management**: Users can add, delete, and view tasks through the web interface.
- **User Authentication**: Implemented user registration, login, and logout functionalities.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the ESP32 microcontroller and ensure the SD card is inserted properly.
2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install the required libraries using PlatformIO or Arduino IDE.
   - Configure the WiFi access point credentials (`ssid` and `password`).
3. **SD Card Setup**: Ensure the SD card is formatted correctly and contains the necessary files (`indexLegacy.html`, `bootstrap.min.css`, `bootstrap.bundle.min.js`, `three.min.js`).
4. **Database Setup**:
   - If the `task.db` file doesn't exist on the SD card, it will be created automatically.
   - Ensure the necessary table (`tasks`) exists in the database for storing tasks.
5. **Compilation and Upload**: Compile and upload the code to the ESP32 using PlatformIO or Arduino IDE.
6. **Accessing the Captive Portal**: Connect to the ESP32 access point using the provided SSID and password. Open a web browser and navigate to the assigned IP address to access the captive portal.

## Usage

- **Task Management**:
  - Add a new task by entering the task description and clicking "Save".
  - Delete a task by clicking the "Delete" button next to the task.
- **User Authentication**:
  - Register a new user by providing a username and password on the registration page.
  - Login with registered credentials to access additional features.
  - Logout to terminate the session.
